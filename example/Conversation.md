# Flink MCP Tools - AI Interaction Examples

## Test 1: Initialize Connection
**User:** Connect to my Flink cluster at http://localhost:8081

**Assistant:** I'll connect to your Flink cluster.

Successfully connected to your Flink cluster at http://localhost:8081! The connection is now active and ready for queries.

---

## Test 2: Check Connection Status
**User:** Can you verify the connection status?

**Assistant:** I'll check the connection status for you.

Connection verified! You're successfully connected to http://localhost:8081 and ready to interact with your Flink cluster.

---

## Test 3: Get Cluster Info
**User:** Can you get the Flink cluster info?

**Assistant:** I'll get the Flink cluster information for you.

Here's your Flink cluster overview:

**Cluster Capacity:**
- **TaskManagers:** 1 active
- **Total Slots:** 1
- **Available Slots:** 0 (‚ö†Ô∏è Cluster at full capacity)

**Job Statistics:**
- **Running:** 1 job
- **Finished:** 1 job
- **Cancelled:** 1 job
- **Failed:** 3 jobs

**Analysis:**
Your cluster is currently at 100% capacity with all slots in use. You have one job actively running. The cluster has experienced 3 failed jobs, which might be worth investigating. You won't be able to start new jobs until the current job completes or you add more TaskManagers/slots.

---

## Test 4: List All Jobs
**User:** Can you list all the jobs in my Flink cluster?

**Assistant:** I'll list all the jobs in your Flink cluster.

Here are all the jobs in your Flink cluster:

**Active Jobs:**
1. **print_words** (RUNNING)
   - Job ID: `7874e8e0d0e46d1aaf06bd01693363c0`
   - Full Name: `insert-into_default_catalog.default_database.print_words`
   - Status: ‚úÖ Currently running

This is your only active job. It appears to be a streaming job that writes data to a table called `print_words`. Would you like to see detailed metrics or configuration for this job?

---

## Test 5: Get Detailed Job Information
**User:** Get details for job 7874e8e0d0e46d1aaf06bd01693363c0

**Assistant:** I'll get comprehensive details for that job.

Here's the comprehensive analysis of your job:

**Job Overview:**
- **Name:** print_words pipeline
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Running smoothly
- **Duration:** 1 hour 5 minutes and counting
- **Type:** Streaming job

**What It Does:**
This is a 3-stage data pipeline:
1. **Source:** Reads words from `random_words` table
2. **Transform:** Converts words to UPPERCASE using `UPPER()` function
3. **Sink:** Writes the transformed words to `print_words` table

**Configuration:**
- Execution mode: PIPELINED (streaming)
- Parallelism: 1 (can scale up to 128)
- No custom restart strategy (using cluster defaults)

**Performance Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Job is healthy with no issues detected
- All operators are fused into a single task for efficiency
- Low parallelism (1) - could be scaled horizontally if needed
- No backpressure or idle time issues

**Recommendations:**
- Job is running optimally for its current workload
- If throughput needs increase, consider raising parallelism
- Currently using 1 slot out of 128 possible - plenty of room to scale

---

## Test 6: Get Job Metrics
**User:** Show me the metrics for this job

**Assistant:** I'll fetch the detailed metrics for your job.

Excellent metrics! Your job is performing exceptionally well:

**Runtime Statistics:**
- ‚è∞ **Uptime:** 1 hour 5 minutes (continuous operation)
- ‚úÖ **100% productive time** - no downtime or interruptions
- üîÑ **Zero restarts** - rock solid stability

**Checkpointing Performance:**
- ‚úÖ **373 successful checkpoints** (100% success rate!)
- ‚ùå **Zero failed checkpoints**
- ‚ö° **Lightning fast:** Last checkpoint completed in < 1 second
- üìà **Checkpoint rate:** ~5.7 checkpoints/minute (every ~10 seconds)
- üíæ **Minimal state:** Near-zero checkpoint sizes (stateless job)

**Health Assessment:**
üü¢ **EXCELLENT** - This job is a model of stability:
- No failures or restarts in over an hour
- Perfect checkpoint success rate
- Extremely efficient checkpointing
- Consistent, predictable behavior

This is exactly what you want to see in a production streaming job!

## Test 7: List TaskManagers
**User:** Show me all the TaskManagers in my cluster

**Assistant:** I'll get detailed information about all TaskManagers.

Here's the detailed TaskManager analysis:

**Cluster Capacity:**
- üî¥ **100% slot utilization** - Cluster is at full capacity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No free slots** - Cannot accept new jobs

**Hardware Resources:**
- **CPU:** 16 cores available
- **Memory:** 7.63 GB total (93.4% used - running hot!)
- **Free Memory:** Only 512 MB remaining

**Critical Issues:**

1. **üö® Massive CPU Underutilization**
   - 16 CPU cores available
   - Only 1 task slot configured
   - **You're wasting 15 CPU cores!**

2. **‚ö†Ô∏è High Memory Pressure**
   - 93.4% memory utilization
   - Only 6.6% free memory remaining

3. **üîí No Capacity for New Jobs**
   - All slots occupied
   - Need to wait for current job to finish or scale up

**Recommendations:**

1. **Increase Slots:** 
   - Set `taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots` to 8-12
   - This will let you run multiple jobs and increase parallelism

2. **Monitor Memory:**
   - Currently at 93.4% usage
   - Adding more slots will require careful memory management

3. **Consider Scaling:**
   - Option A: Increase slots per TaskManager (better CPU utilization)
   - Option B: Add more TaskManagers (more memory, more slots)

Your hardware can support much more parallelism than currently configured!

## Test 8: Get Job Exceptions
**User:** Check if there are any exceptions for the failed job 2abd81b7ae81e2f690ed2dc07763d6b0

**Assistant:** I'll retrieve the exceptions for that failed job.

Found the root cause of the job failure!

**Root Cause:**
üî¥ **Connection Refused** - The job couldn't connect to its socket source

**What Happened:**
1. Job: Socket Window WordCount
2. Failed Task: Socket Stream source
3. Error: `java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused`
4. Location: Line 109 in SocketTextStreamFunction

**Why It Failed:**
The job was trying to read from a socket stream (typically used with `nc` or netcat), but:
- ‚ùå The socket source wasn't running
- ‚ùå Or the host/port was unreachable
- ‚ùå Or the connection was blocked

**Additional Problem:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **No Restart Strategy Configured** - The job had `NoRestartBackoffTimeStrategy`, so it failed immediately instead of retrying

**How to Fix:**

1. **Start the socket source first:**
   ```bash
   nc -lk 9999  # Start netcat on port 9999
   ```

2. **Then start the Flink job**

3. **For production, use reliable sources:**
   - Kafka
   - File systems
   - Database CDC
   - Not socket connections!

4. **Configure a restart strategy:**
   ```java
   env.setRestartStrategy(RestartStrategies.fixedDelayRestart(
       3,  // number of restart attempts
       Time.of(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)  // delay
   ));
   ```

Socket-based sources are great for demos but not recommended for production due to reliability issues like this!

## Test 9: List JAR Files
**User:** Show me all uploaded JAR files in the cluster

**Assistant:** I'll list all the JAR files uploaded to your Flink cluster.

**JAR Files Status:**

üì¶ **No JAR files currently uploaded** to the cluster.

This means:
- All running jobs were submitted via SQL or other methods (not JAR submission)
- The `/jars` directory is empty
- Jobs are likely running through Flink SQL, PyFlink, or direct API calls

**To upload a JAR:**
You can upload JAR files through:
1. Flink Web UI ‚Üí Submit New Job ‚Üí Add New
2. REST API: `POST /jars/upload`
3. Flink CLI: `flink run -d your-job.jar`

Would you like help with any other cluster operations?
