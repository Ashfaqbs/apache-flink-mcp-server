## Test 8: Get Job Exceptions
**User:** Check if there are any exceptions for the failed job 2abd81b7ae81e2f690ed2dc07763d6b0

**Assistant:** I'll retrieve the exceptions for that failed job.

Found the root cause of the job failure!

**Root Cause:**
üî¥ **Connection Refused** - The job couldn't connect to its socket source

**What Happened:**
1. Job: Socket Window WordCount
2. Failed Task: Socket Stream source
3. Error: `java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused`
4. Location: Line 109 in SocketTextStreamFunction

**Why It Failed:**
The job was trying to read from a socket stream (typically used with `nc` or netcat), but:
- ‚ùå The socket source wasn't running
- ‚ùå Or the host/port was unreachable
- ‚ùå Or the connection was blocked

**Additional Problem:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **No Restart Strategy Configured** - The job had `NoRestartBackoffTimeStrategy`, so it failed immediately instead of retrying

**How to Fix:**

1. **Start the socket source first:**
   ```bash
   nc -lk 9999  # Start netcat on port 9999
   ```

2. **Then start the Flink job**

3. **For production, use reliable sources:**
   - Kafka
   - File systems
   - Database CDC
   - Not socket connections!

4. **Configure a restart strategy:**
   ```java
   env.setRestartStrategy(RestartStrategies.fixedDelayRestart(
       3,  // number of restart attempts
       Time.of(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)  // delay
   ));
   ```

Socket-based sources are great for demos but not recommended for production due to reliability issues like this!

## Test 9: List JAR Files
**User:** Show me all uploaded JAR files in the cluster

**Assistant:** I'll list all the JAR files uploaded to your Flink cluster.

**JAR Files Status:**

üì¶ **No JAR files currently uploaded** to the cluster.

This means:
- All running jobs were submitted via SQL or other methods (not JAR submission)
- The `/jars` directory is empty
- Jobs are likely running through Flink SQL, PyFlink, or direct API calls

**To upload a JAR:**
You can upload JAR files through:
1. Flink Web UI ‚Üí Submit New Job ‚Üí Add New
2. REST API: `POST /jars/upload`
3. Flink CLI: `flink run -d your-job.jar`

Would you like help with any other cluster operations?
